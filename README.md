# Express-App-API-TODO

//
What is middleware? How does it get used? How do you check it?
How do you add custom middlware to routes?

Why do we move code and export and require?
What is requiring a module and then how do I mount it?

Create 1st GET /todos and test it with POSTMAN where we created collections > environment > route

Created 2nd GET / todos/:id & tested it with postman & pushed to heroku and created -environmental > Route

//REFFACTOR using underscore.js
get todos/:id

refactor POST todos using function .pick
